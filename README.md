# Credit Risk Classification Challenge

In this Challenge, we use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk.

A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company is used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.


## 1. Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

- How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

**99.54% of the Healthy loans were correctly predicted as Healthy by the model**

**94.88% of the High-risk loans were correctly predicted as High-risk by the model**


## 3. Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

An overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The results: Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

A summary: Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you donâ€™t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
